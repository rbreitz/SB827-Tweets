# SB827-Tweets
California, particularly in coastal cities, has a really significant housing crisis. Recently, an ambitious bill was put forward in the California state senate that would have overrided local zoning laws in order to permit the construction of dense housing near frequent public transit stops. Unfortunately the bill died in committee before any real polling could be done to see whether the broader community wanted it. I thought I'd try to do some sentiment analysis on some Tweets on #SB827 in order to gauge support for the bill. Overall, 78% of the tweets in the set seemed to be supportive of the bill, with 77% of tweets from the West Coast and 80% of tweets from elsewhere expressing support of the bill. It seems likely that there is enough broad support that a similar bill could succeed in the future.
